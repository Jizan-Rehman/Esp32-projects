# Stepper Motor Driver (Wokwi Simulation)

This project demonstrates stepper motor control using an A4988 driver and Esp32 in the Wokwi simulator.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components Used
- ESP32
- A4988 Stepper Motor Driver  
- NEMA 17 Stepper Motor   
- Push Buttons (Start/Stop, Home limit, End limit)  

## üß† Functional Flow
1. Power / Start (P1 Button)
‚Ä¢ Pressing P1 toggles between starting and stopping the motor.
‚Ä¢ The motor resumes motion in the same direction it was rotating before it was
stopped, ensuring smooth continuation of operation.
‚Ä¢ If homing has not been completed yet, the homing function is executed first.

2. Homing Sequence (P2 Button)
‚Ä¢ During homing, the motor rotates toward the home limit switch (P2) until
the switch is pressed.
‚Ä¢ After detecting the home switch (pressing P2), the motor moves slightly in the
opposite direction to back off.
‚Ä¢ Then it moves slowly again toward the home switch (p2) for precise zero
positioning.
‚Ä¢ Once P2 is pressed again, homing is complete, the motor‚Äôs position is
considered zero.
‚Ä¢ The motor starts rotating clockwise towards P3.

3. Normal Operation
‚Ä¢ When the end-limit switch (P3) is pressed, the motor reverses direction to
counter-clockwise.
‚Ä¢ When the home-limit switch (P2) is pressed again, the motor reverses
direction back to clockwise.
‚Ä¢ This creates continuous back-and-forth motion between the two limits.

4. Stop Operation
‚Ä¢ Pressing P1 again stops the motor immediately.
‚Ä¢ The current rotation direction is remembered, so when restarted, the motor
resumes motion in the same previous direction.
